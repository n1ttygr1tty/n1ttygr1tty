a complete noob, zero experience but a work ethic and drive to carry my piqued interest forward. just trying to figure out which way. its a lonely and dark path currently. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to not go down to many rabbit holes and be okay with less than perfect to begin. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that isngoing to help set us up for success and become the basis and foundation from which we can build
off of securely.
